WeatherApp is a dynamic application that provides real-time weather information based on user-selected locations.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in developing weather-focused applications by integrating external APIs, handling data,
and creating an engaging user interface.

#Technologies Used
Swift programming language.
SwiftUI framework for building a modern and responsive UI.
Networking capabilities for API integration.
Core Location for user's current location.
